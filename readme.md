# ThermoTools Homepage

Page hosted at [thermotools.github.io](thermotools.github.io)

Built using Jekyll and GitHub pages. Serves as a simple interface to the homepages for repositories under the Thermotools Project.

To build and test the page locally, you need `bundle` and `jekyll`. From the root directory of the repo, run

```
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The page is simply generated from the file `index.html`. The figures are generated using the various python scripts in 
`assets/graphics`.
